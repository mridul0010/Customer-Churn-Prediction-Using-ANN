        While precise factor weights depend on the model architecture, in churn analysis, the following factors often contribute significantly to risk:
        1. **Age:** Older customers (especially 50+) can show increased risk of exiting if not actively engaged.
        2. **Balance & Products:** High balance combined with a low number of products can signal poor customer relationship and high flight risk.
        3. **Inactive Status:** The 'IsActiveMember' status is a strong indicator; inactive customers are far more likely to churn.
